In six easy steps you will have a ready to use Python project with batteries included.

**1.  Generate Your Project from the Template**

  Run the following command and follow the prompts in your terminal:
  ```bash
  cruft create https://github.com/saezlab/python-project.git --checkout master
  ```

**2. Navigate to Your New Project Directory**
```bash
cd <my-project> # replace with the name of your project
```

**3. Set Up and Activate a Virtual Environment using `uv`**
```bash
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

  ```bash
  uv pip install ".[dev,tests,docs]"
  ```

**5. Install and update pre-commit hooks**
```bash
git init
pre-commit install
pre-commit autoupdate
```

**6. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub**

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create <GitHub-organization>/<my-project>  --public --source=. --push
```
