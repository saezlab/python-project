## How-to use this template?

In five steps you will have a ready to use Python project with batteries included.

**1.  Generate Your Project from the Template**

  Run the following command and follow the prompts in your terminal:
  ```bash
  cookiecutter gh:saezlab/python-project
  ```

**2. Navigate to Your New Project Directory**
```bash
cd <my-project> # replace with the name of your project
```

**3. Set Up and Activate a Virtual Environment using `uv`**
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
> This creates and activates a lightweight virtual environment in `.venv`.


**4. Install Project Dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file**

  Install all required and optional dependencies (development, testing, docs):
  ```bash
  uv pip install ".[dev,tests,docs]"
  ```

**5. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
gh repo create <GitHub-organization>/<my-project>  --public --source=. --push
```
